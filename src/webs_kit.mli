(** Authenticated cookies.

    An authenticated cookie lets your service store expirable state on
    the client with the guarantee that it cannot tamper with it. The
    data is {b not encrypted}, this is not made to store service
    secrets on the client.

    In order to use this you need a private key in your service. An
    easy way to handle this is to generate one randomly with
    {!Authenticatable.random_key} when you start your service. Note
    however that this invalidates any data currently stored on your
    clients whenever you restart your service â€“ that may be okay, or
    not. *)

      authenticated and expired by [key] and [now] (see

      they default to {!Webs.Http.Cookie.atts_default}. *)

(** Sessions.

    Sessions maintain state across request/response cycles. This module
    provides a basic infrastructure to abstract the mecanism handling
    sessions.

    client-side sessions via {!Authenticated_cookie}s.

    {- Provide a reasonably efficient and convenient (Tpf ?) binary
       solution for {!state} codec.}

       to refresh on each request. Understand caching issues. Global salty
       invalidation ?}
    {- Add session handler init hooks and expiry cleanup}
    {- Should {!state} be as a heterogenous dict with
       serialisation ? That makes state composable, but implicitely
       composable. We should rather go for
       explicit compositionality and state design.}} *)
