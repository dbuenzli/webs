synopsis: "HTTP toolkit for OCaml"
description: """\
Webs is a toolkit for programming with HTTP in OCaml. It provides:

* IO and HTTP version agnostic representations for HTTP requests and responses.
* A client connector abstraction for making HTTP client requests with
  HTTP client implementations.
* A service connector abstraction for running HTTP services defined as 
  functions mapping requests to responses. Simple CGI and HTTP/1.1 gateway 
  connectors are provided, but you can bring your own.
* Optional HTTP service building blocks. File serving, authenticated
  cookies, sessions, etc.

Webs is not a framework, it is a set of building blocks.

Webs is distributed under the ISC license. The base library only
depends on [`bytesrw`]. Some service building blocks and the optional
gateway connectors depend on OCaml's `Unix` and `Thread` modules. The
command line support depends on [`cmdliner`].
