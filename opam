synopsis: "HTTP toolkit for OCaml"
description: """\
Webs is a toolkit for programming with HTTP in OCaml. It provides:

* IO agnostic representations for HTTP requests and responses.
* Optional HTTP service building blocks. File serving, authenticated
  cookies, sessions, etc.
* Connectors for running HTTP services defined as functions mapping
  requests to responses. CGI and HTTP/1.1 gateway connectors are
  provided, but you can bring your own.

Webs is not a framework, it is a set of building blocks.

Webs is distributed under the ISC license. The base library has no
dependencies. Some building blocks and the built-in gateway connectors
depend on OCaml's `Unix` and `Thread` modules. The command line
support depends on [`cmdliner`].
