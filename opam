synopsis: "Web service toolkit for OCaml"
description: """\
Webs is a toolkit for programming web services in OCaml. It provides:

* A generic low-level interface for defining web services in terms
  of HTTP request-responses cycles.
* Optional service building blocks. File serving, authenticated
  cookies, sessions, HTML generation, etc.
* Connectors. They run services and are in charge of talking 
  to the HTTP gateway or client. CGI and HTTP/1.1 gateway
  connectors are provided, but you can bring your own.

Webs is a set of libraries and building block, not a framework.

Webs is distributed under the ISC license. It has no dependencies. The
connector libraries depend on OCaml's `Unix` and `Thread` modules.
