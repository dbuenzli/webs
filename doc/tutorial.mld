This means you need a private key in your service. An easy way to
handle this is o generate one randomly with
{!Webs_authenticatable.Private_key.random_hs256} when you start

stored on your clients whenever you restart your service â€“ that may be

it's not. Also if you use a single service key you cannot invalidate
the data of your clients on a per-user basis.
