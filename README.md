Webs â€” HTTP toolkit for OCaml
=============================

Webs is a toolkit for programming with HTTP in OCaml. It provides:

* IO and HTTP version agnostic representations for HTTP requests and responses.
* A client connector abstraction for making HTTP client requests with
  HTTP client implementations.
* A service connector abstraction for running HTTP services defined as 
  functions mapping requests to responses. Simple CGI and HTTP/1.1 gateway 
  connectors are provided, but you can bring your own.
* Optional HTTP service building blocks. File serving, authenticated
  cookies, sessions, etc.

Webs is not a framework, it is a set of building blocks.

Webs is distributed under the ISC license. The base library only
depends on [`bytesrw`]. Some service building blocks and the optional
gateway connectors depend on OCaml's `Unix` and `Thread` modules. The
command line support depends on [`cmdliner`].

## Installation

Webs can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install webs
    opam install webs cmdliner # with cmdliner support

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

## Documentation

The documentation can be consulted [online] or via `odig doc webs`.

Questions are welcome but better asked on the [OCaml forum] than on
the issue tracker.

## Sample programs 

A few programs can be found in the [examples](examples) directory,
see `b0 list`. You  can run them for example with 

    b0 -- authedcookie

The [`webs`](examples/webs_tool.ml) command line tool serves files
over unencrypted HTTP/1.1 and makes HTTP requests with a `curl`
backend.
