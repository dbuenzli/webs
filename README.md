Webs — Web service interface for OCaml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release %%VERSION%%

Webs defines a generic and *low-level* interface for web services
implemented in OCaml. The interaction between the service and the HTTP
web server that runs it is mediated by a connector whose details
depend on the webserver. The Webs library provides optional CGI and
SCGI connectors.

Webs depends on [Rresult][1] and is distributed the BSD3 license. The optional
SCGI connector depend on [Bos][2] and OCaml's Unix library.

## Installation

Webs can be installed with `opam`:

instructions.

## Documentation

The documentation and API reference is automatically generated by
`ocamldoc` from the interfaces. It can be consulted [online][3]
and there is a generated version in the `doc` directory of the
distribution.
